in ProxyService.doGet
- why get the query string, parse it and then convert from UTF-8 to ISO-8859-1
- why isn't the query string stored in the url in the session (for portlet render fetches)

in ProxyService.fetch
- why use aHttpServletResponse.sendError(HttpServletResponse.SC_FOUND); instead of response.sendRedirect
