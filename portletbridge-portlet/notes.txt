in ProxyService.doGet
- why get the query string, parse it and then convert from UTF-8 to ISO-8859-1
- why isn't the query string stored in the url in the session (for portlet render fetches)
- external stylesheets and javascript aren't rewritten. the servlet is the only place to rewrite them
  but if the servlet rewrites them, it's not going to be able to correctly rewrite link urls in stylesheets
  or javascript.

in ProxyService.fetch
- why use aHttpServletResponse.sendError(HttpServletResponse.SC_FOUND); instead of response.sendRedirect
