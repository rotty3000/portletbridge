<p>
The Portlet Bridge project is intended to allow regular web sites be 
hosted as portlets. See the <a href="/multiproject/portletbridge-portlet/index.html">PortletBridge Portlet</a>
project for more information.
</p>
<p>
In addition to creating a bridging portlet, this project will also include support for proxying
HTML without a portal container. There is a demo of portletbridge acting as a HTML proxy 
<a href="http://www.portletbridge.org:8080/portletbridge/http://www.theregister.com/">here</a>
which demonstrates the portletbridge in action. Please note, however:
<ul>
<li>It's very slow because the demo is on a very slow link</li>
<li>It doesn't rewrite javascript</li>
<li>The code is changed on its way through the HTMLSAXParser and link rewriter which does result
in unwanted artifacts</li>
</ul>
See the <a href="/multiproject/portletbridge-web/index.html">portletbridge-web</a> project for
configuration settings.
</p>

<section name="Requirements">
