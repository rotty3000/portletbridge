      <question>
        What is the PortletBridge Portlet?
      </question>
      <answer>
        <p>The PortletBridge Portlet is a JSR 168 compliant portlet that 
        allows a downstream web site to be proxied as a portlet. By default
        it only displays the content of the BODY but custom XSLT can be used
        to transform the data from the downstream site.</p>

      <question>
        What is the difference between the PortletBridge Portlet and an IFrame
      </question>
      <answer>
        <p>
        There are several differences between using an IFrame and the PortletBridge
        Portlet. Probably the biggest advantage to using an IFrame is that it is
        simpler than the PortletBridge Portlet and the downstream site will often
        be more faithfully rendered. There are however several advantages to using
        the PortletBridge Portlet.
        <ul>
          <li>
            Where an IFrame is like a window onto another site, the PortletBridge
            Portlet bahaves more like a portlet, providing a block of HTML into your
            portal page.
          </li>
          <li>
            IFrames don't resize easily to accomodate the size of the downstream 
            content (this may be an advantage but you can change the PortletBridge
            Portlet to do the same by putting a fixed size div into the XSLT around
            the content).
          </li>
          <li>
            IFrame URL's take you out of the Portal. This is often not the behaviour
            you'd expect from a Portlet (The PortletBridge Portlet can be configured
            either way using the "scope" preference).
          </li>
          <li>
            You may not want to expose the whole downstream site to the general 
            public. An IFrame URL must be reachable by your browser.
          </li>
          <li>
            You can't rewrite the content of your IFrame which means that it while looks
            exactly like the downstream site, it may not look like the rest of your
            portal. The PortletBridge portlet allows you to modify the XSLT that
            transforms the content.
          </li>
          <li>
            An IFrame will show everything from the downstream site. The PortletBridge
            Portlet allows for "web clipping" using custom XSLT which means you only
            get what you want.
          </li>
          <li>
            Finally, while IFrames work on most browsers, they don't work on them all
            nor are they supported in the XHTML spec. PortletBridge would probably 
            be a better choice under these circumstances.

      <question>
        I'm getting an InvalidClassException, what should I do?
      </question>
      <answer>
        If your exception looks something like the snippet below it's because the serialversionid
        of the class changed and tomcat is trying to unfreeze an old instance of the object from
        the session. You should be able to ignore this. If not, let me know (dkfn at users.sourceforge.net)
