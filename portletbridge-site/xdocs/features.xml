<section name="PortletBridge Portlet Features">
<p>
The PortletBridge Portlet project creates a JSR-168 Portlet that can proxy and rewrite
content from a downstream web site. Currently, the portlet supports:
<ul>
<li>Getting content from a downstream site</li>
<li>Proxy configuration (including NTLM and Basic authentication)</li>
<li>NTLM and Basic authentication as preferences</li>
<li>Using an xsl stylesheet to rewrite the content from the downstream site</li>
<li>Proxying of remote resources (e.g. images, flash etc.)</li>
<li>Regular expression defining which URL's are in the portlet and which should be regular links</li>
<li>XSL Stylesheets packaged as part of the portlet or remote (URL based)</li>
<li>Links to binary files</li>
<li>Help and Edit modes</li>
<li>Rewriting CSS urls</li>
<li>Moving javascript and css links out of the head</li>
<li>Hiding of downstream URLs and configurable scope</li>
<li>Back button and refresh support</li>
<li>Tested in Pluto 1.0.1 rc4</li>
<li>Tested in JBoss Portal 2.0</li>
<li>Tested in LifeRay Professional 3.6.0</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
The size of the PortletBridge portlet is due to the inclusion of the Xalan and Xerces
jars for rewriting the content from the downstream site.
